I read through the assignment and took notes on each different thing I had to implement and in what order. I then attempted to execute it and went to office hours when necessary. Christo Wilson helped me when I was having trouble connecting to my data channel. I used the python docs as a reference while coding. I tested by printing out the commands I was sending through my channels and what I was recieving from the server.
